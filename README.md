1 Project overview:

 Microsoft want to know if its viable to enter in to the movies industry and if they invest in it will get back there return on investment and what movies to produce. The main objective of the project is to give unbiased findings and the action to take.
2 Business understanding:
Microsoft wants to know which movies to produce that will give them high yields, and keep then on top of the list  by providing the most popular movies.
To be able to get to meet there expectations we need to find the Return on investment (ROI) for several genres across the years, we would need to gather data on box office revenues and production budgets for movies in each genre, as well as other relevant data such as marketing costs and distribution expenses.
We could then calculate the ROI for each movie by subtracting the production budget and other costs from the box office revenue, and dividing the result by the production budget. By aggregating these ROI values for each genre across the years, we could then identify which genres have historically provided the highest ROI and which have underperformed. Knowing these it will enable the management make informed decision on what to invest in.
 
3 Key business questions:
From the data understanding and preparation the business question we are trying to answer is does runtime in minutes of movie title have an impact on worldwide_ gross?

Does popularity make domestic gross sales of movies increase?

         the business question we are trying to answer is to find the Return on investment(ROI) for several genres across the years.

4 Data understanding and Analysis
 The data was provided by Microsoft and sourced from various websites on the internet. They came in different formats some were CSV files and others were Tsv files. They are as follows 

Box Office Mojo 
IMDB
Rotten Tomatoes
TheMovieDB

5 Visualization
I used different graphs to explain the above questions for example the relationship between Runtime and worldwide Gross.
The scatter graphs I used in the study gave more insight on the correlation between popularity and domestic gross
6 Recommendation

According to my findings its very viable for Microsoft to enter into the movie industry and they should invest more on marketing so as to become more popular which leads to increased  sales hence more return on investment. 
.This recommendation is based on the high worldwide gross sales of movies in these genres as evidenced by our analysis.
Overall, this dataset provides valuable information for anyone interested in the movie industry or data analysis.
